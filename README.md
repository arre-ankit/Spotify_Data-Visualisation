# Spotify_Data_Visualisation

I have analysised on a Spotify dataset sourced from Kaggle, focusing on key metrics such as the number of songs per year, duration variations across the years (1990-2021), and the identification of the top five genres based on popularity.

Utilized data visualization techniques to present insightful trends and patterns in the Spotify dataset, effectively communicating findings to stakeholders and facilitating data-driven decision-making.

Employed advanced analytical methods to derive meaningful insights from the dataset, providing valuable recommendations for marketing strategies, playlist curation, and genre preferences to enhance the user experience and drive engagement on the platform.
